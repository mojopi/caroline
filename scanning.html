<span id="h1">scan + cyan</span>
<p>
	You could imagine using various tools and materials to see plants and animals in new ways. Recently, I've been using a flatbed scanner to scan different types of flowers, leaves, and seeds. With this tool, I can capture a perspective that I would never be able to get with a traditional camera. <br><br> 

	The idea of scanning plants was inspired by a beautiful book about seaweed called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I53DMEA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">The Ocean Garden</a>. Seaweed seems like a particularly good medium to scan because it is flat and transparent. I've found that flat plants and animal parts (eg. ferns leaves, grass flowers, feathers) are also well-suited to this tool.

	<br><br>

	I've also started putting plants directly on special paper to "draw with sunlight" and make cyanotypes (blue prints that use chemical reactions with UV light). I'm particularly excited about making prints of  root systems this way.
